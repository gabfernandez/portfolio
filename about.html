        <p class="anything">Delran High School sophomore, Gabby Fernandez, loves studying the way the human brain makes people behave and plans to study behavioral sciences. An enthusiastic STEM scholar, Gabby was excited by the opportunity to attend the summer STEM academy, SMASH@Wharton. Living on campus with 34 other scholars studying biology, mathematics, computer science, design thinking, economics, and marketing, Gabby’s team is studying Pertussis and developing a project to improve public awareness of the disease and prevention. Gabby plans to pursue a career in behavioral science. “In the future, I want to use STEM to give back to my community”.</p>
